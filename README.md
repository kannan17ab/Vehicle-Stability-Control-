# Vehicle-Stability-Control-
The Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system is a dynamic vehicle safety feature that improves stability during understeer or oversteer conditions. It uses sensor data to evaluate the vehicle's behavior, calculates yaw deviation, and applies targeted braking and engine torque reduction to maintain directional control.
